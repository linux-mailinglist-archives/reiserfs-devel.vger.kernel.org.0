Hello Dear,

My names are David Ben, I have sent you two emails and you did not respond, I even sent another message a few days ago with more details still no response from you.

Please are you still using this email address? I am VERY SORRY if sincerely you did not receive those emails, I will resend it now as soon as you confirm you never received them.

Regards,

Mr. David Ben.
