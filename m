I'AM SUFFERING FROM CANCER OF THE HEART


Dear Friend,


Greetings to you in the name of the Lord God Almighty am  Mrs Nicole
Marois from (Paris) France, but am based in Burkina Faso Africa for
eight years now as a business woman dealing on gold exportation and
cotton Sales. But I have been suffering from this deadly disease
called cancer for long and the doctor just said I have just few days
to leave.  I know it will be difficult for you to believe my story now
,but this is the situation I found myself  in, it=E2=80=99s not my desire t=
o
be on a sick bed today but God knows best,


Now, that I am about to end the race like this, without any family
members and no child. I have $5.8 Million US DOLLARS in BANK OF AFRICA
(B.O.A) Burkina Faso it=E2=80=99s all my life savings, I instructed the Ban=
k
to give it to St Andrews Missionary and Home Kizito Orphanage in
Burkina Faso. But my mind is not at rest because i do not trust them,
I am writing this letter now through the help of my computer beside My
sick bed.


I will instruct the bank to transfer this fund to you as a foreigner,
but you will have to promise me that you will take 50% of the fund and
give 50% to charity like the orphanage home in your country for my
soul to rest in peace. Please respond to me immediately for further
details since I have just few days to lose my life to this deadly
disease, hoping you will understand my situation and give favorable
attention look forward to getting a reply from you.


Thanks and God bless you,

Mrs Nicole Marois
