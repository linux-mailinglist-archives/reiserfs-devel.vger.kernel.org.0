Hi, Jan,

As the filesystem has problems with the "General Protection Fault", which I learned later and
I am really not qualified to deal with that, just fixing compiler warnings is indeed cosmetics and an
exercise for the little grey cells.

Es ist nicht meine ernst, as Germans would have said.

But I will trust your judgment on whether this is worth patching.

Best regards,
Mirsad Todorovac
